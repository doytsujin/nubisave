			<h1>Learn how it works</h1>
			A scientific publication about the goals, concepts and architecture decisions behind NubiSave as well as its
			remaining limitations has been submitted and accepted for publication at the
			<a href="http://www.cloudbus.org/ucc2011/">4th IEEE International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</a> in December 2011:
			<ul>
			<li>J. Spillner, G. Bombach, S. Matthischke, J. MÃ¼ller, R. Tzschichholz, A. Schill: Information Dispersion over Redundant Arrays of Optimal Cloud Storage for Desktop Users
			(read <a href="downloads/dispersal-raoc-nubisave.pdf">preprint</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			For a less technical explanation, please read the background information below.

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			Mozilla's "take back the web" applied to cloud computing means "take back data sovereignty"!
			NubiSave is designed to achieve exactly this by establishing a local cloud storage controller within the realm
			of the user - either directly as backup user, or as administrator responsible for securing the data of a group of people.
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Technical Background</h2>
			Storing data locally on disks which are subject to breakage, theft and technical restrictions in capacity and performance
			has led to sophisticated concepts for encryption and for connecting disks as striped (RAID-0), fully redundant (RAID-1) or
			error-coding redundant (e.g. RAID-5) arrays.
			In the cloud, however, users entrust all of their data to a single storage provider, either with encryption, or without.
			Even encrypted cloud storage is still subject to unauthorised storage area access, deletion and brute-force attacks on the encryption.
			Data dispersal (RAIC-n for n &gt;= 1) is the concept of ensuring that each provider only gets a part of the data, while at the same time
			reaching higher long-term availability and access performance. NubiSave introduces RAOC-n for optimally selected storage providers
			over which a RAIC-n is constructed.
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Architecture</h2>
			NubiSave allows for flexible chaining of splitter (1:n) and modifier (1:1) modules.
			This makes it possible to send parts of the data unmodified to one provider, encrypt for a
			second provider and compress for a third provider.
			One possible setup consisting of three storage providers is shown in the diagram below:
