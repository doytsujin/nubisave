			<h1>NubiSave integration options</h1>
			Of course, it is possible to just run NubiSave as a stand-alone tool
			beneath a local virtual directory.
			However, in many cases it might be more useful to run something on top
			of it or in addition - like a web interface, a network integrator
			or a status monitor.
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Web access</h2>
			NubiSave can serve as backend to practically any web-based data management tool.
			It does not have its own frontend on purpose, because so many already exist
			- one tool for each job.
			<a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a> seems to be a very popular choice these days.
		</div>

			<h2>Network integrator/Storage gateway</h2>
			Likewise, NubiSave doesn't include any local or wide area network integration proxy.
			It is possible to run both SMB/CIFS servers (such as <a href="http://samba.org/">Samba</a>)
			and WebDAV servers (such as <a href="http://webdav.org/catacomb/">Apache httpd/mod_dav/Catacomb</a>)
			on top of NubiSave-provided directories. Interestingly, this allows remote chaining
			of NubiSave installations!
			A policy-driven storage gateway on top of NubiSave has been proposed in the ongoing
			work on the Flexible Data Distribution Policy (FlexDDPL). It is under development.
			<blockquote>
			<i>We intend to publish the storage gateway as proposed in the FlexDDPL paper.
			We also intend to offer a reasonable setup recipe by integrating the results from
			<a href="http://flexcloud.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/seccsie_ieee.pdf">SecCSIE</a>.</i>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Status monitor</h2>
			Does NubiSave also not ship with a status monitor? Actually, we provide one for you
			because there don't seem to be useful ones, not even for user-friendly RAID monitoring :-)
			Please download it from the <a href="http://flexcloud.eu/?p=1698">AllocDemo page</a>
			while it is under development.
