			NubiSave is a freely available user-space controller for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive, Independent or even Optimal Clouds (RAIC/RAOC).<br/>
			Through dispersion, the data is secured beyond encryption and made inaccessible in its entirety to the individual storage providers.
			NubiSave is being developed in the context of the <a href="http://flexcloud.eu/">FlexCloud</a> research project.

			<h2>Features</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Builds on FUSE, and integrates with a number of cloud-storage-related FUSE modules, including <a href="https://github.com/joe42/CloudFusion">CloudFusion</a></li>
			<li>Integrates with the <a href="http://serviceplatform.org/">SPACE service platform</a> for optimal storage provider selection, allocation and scheduling</li>
			<li>Offers extensible tree-like interfaces for nested splitters, encryption, steganography, compression, deduplication etc.</li>
			<li>Includes a <a href="screenshots/gui.png">Java setup GUI</a>, now with <a href="screenshots/nubiguigraph.png">graph view</a>, and a (not yet complete) <a href="screenshots/nubitree-simulated.png">PyQT setup GUI</a></li>
			<li>Technical features: optimal redundancy, cache, parallelism, streaming, chunking, sessions, ...</li>
			<li>Developer features: functional unit tests, UI unit tests</li>
			</ul>

Two of our students have teamed up to create an awesome video which demonstrates the basics of dispersion
and RAOC. You can watch it online at <a href="http://flexcloud.eu/">flexcloud.eu</a> or
download the whole <a href="http://flexcloud.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flexcloud-video_H.264_20121121.mp4">explanation video</a>. We celebrate this video by making a new Debian package of NubiSave available which
includes the new graph GUI and a FUSE-J module fix.

A concept for a policy-driven cloud storage gateway, and in particular a policy language to express storage goals and constraints,
has been published at the LatinCloud conference. Read about it on the <a href="learn.html">Learn</a> page.

<a href="http://serviceplatform.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=smartoffice;a=tree;f=allocdemo/nubi-tree">NubiTree</a> is an experimental PyQt GUI for achieving a more intuitive
representation of the cloud storage module tree. It works on both the actual NubiSave configuration and an easily demonstratable simulated tree.
See <a href="screenshots/nubitree-simulated.png">screenshot</a>!

The publication outlining the concepts behind NubiSave has been published and presented at the <a href="http://www.cloudbus.org/ucc2011/">UCC 2011</a> in Melbourne, Australia.
Apparently, it covers a hot topic since it has received a <a href="http://flexcloud.eu/?p=1751">Best Paper Award</a>! Meanwhile, development continues towards
a more usable and powerful prototype.

Website is fairly informative now and goes public.
We invite brave and curious people to try out the current state of NubiSave as long as only test data is stored.

The NubiSave code repository is now publicly available.
This snapshot represents the outcome of the practical lab exercise.
Don't use it yet for storing data without additional backups!
