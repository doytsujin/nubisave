Configuration file overview
---------------------------

/usr/share/nubisave/config:
 Dropbox.ini
 Sugarsync.ini
 -> provider-specific storage configuration for CloudFusion
 nosy.cfg
 -> configuration for the Python Nose unit tests
 logging.conf
 -> logging configuration for CloudFusion

/usr/share/nubisave/splitter:
 log4j.properties
 -> logging configuration for the Nubisave splitter FUSE module
 mountscripts/*
 -> description files and mount/unmount scripts for generic storage modules

/usr/share/nubisave/bin:
 nubi.properties
 -> non-logging configuration for the Nubisave splitter FUSE module
    (see below for details)

~/.nubisave/nubisavemount:
 !! should not exist beforehand, as it is created by Nubisave itself
 config/config
 -> redundancy settings [FIXME: relation to global one in nubi.properties?]
 -> also, strategy and other settings
 config/$module
 -> copied from db/splitter_configuration/module
 -> hot plugging for mounting a storage: generates $module/config/config in .nubisave/storages
 data
 -> the virtual filesystem provided by the Nubisave splitter FUSE module

~/.nubisave/db/splitter_configuration:
 $module
 => one file for each configured storage module

~/.nubisave/storages:
 => one directory for each activated storage module
 => automatically created by hotplugging through nubisavemount/config/$module
 $module/config/config
 -> corresponds to db/splitter_configuration/$module
 $module/data
 -> symlink to the backend filesystem, either native directory or FUSE mountpoint
