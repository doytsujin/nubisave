/usr/share/nubisave/config:
 Dropbox.ini
 Sugarsync.ini

/usr/share/nubisave/bin:
 nubi.properties
 -> non-logging configuration for the Nubisave splitter FUSE module
    (see below for details)

~/.nubisave/nubisavemount:
 !! should not exist beforehand, as it is created by Nubisave itself
 config/config
 -> redundancy settings [FIXME: relation to global one in nubi.properties?]
 config/$module
 -> ??? [FIXME: explain relation to $module/config/config and splitter_configuration/$module]

~/.nubisave/db/splitter_configuration:
 $module
 => one file for each configured storage module

~/.nubisave/storages:
 => one directory for each activated storage module
 $module/config/config
