Functionality of the NubiSave splitter
======================================

A file called
	NAME
is split into fragments which are named
	_NAME#U#C#F

The flags have the following meaning:

U: Chunk counter, for every ~3 MB, always 0 for smaller files
C: File and chunk counter, alias globally unique index in the database
F: Fragment number [0..n-1]

For directories, NAME is normalised into one single file name. For
example, a/b becomes a_b. Non-ASCII symbols are eliminated from NAME.

NAME should probably be turned into a hash value or otherwise be
obfuscated.

NAME is
	.nubisave_databaseN
	.nubisave_session_N_MODULEINSTANCE
for stored sessions, with just one parameter.

N: Session number [1..9]

Furthermore, there are resulting files with a separate naming scheme
	.nubisave_database.metaN
	.nubisave_service_name.sessionN#F

The database meta file format is described below.
The [splitter] section also corresponds to the configuration in the
'nubisavemount/config/config' file. Changes to the 'config' file
are applied immediately, similar to activated module files next
to 'config'.
Redundancy and Storagestrategy are configurable.
Availability is calculated and updated automatically by NubiSave.

Database contents

[splitter]
redundancy = [0..100]
availability = [0.0-1.0]
storagestrategy = RoundRobin|UseAllInParallel

[database]

fileFragmentNameChecksum_0 = [sha256]
fileFragmentName_1 = /_.nubisave_databaseN#U#C#1
fileFragmentNameChecksum_1 = [sha256]

Metadata / Fragment store contents
----------------------------------

The database (~/.nubisave/db.{db,lg}) is of a JDBM H-Tree format which stores
string-to-object mapping records. The strings are path names, whereas the
objects are instances of the "vtf" classes.
The entries exist as maps with names such as:
	filemap
	dirmap
	fileFragmentsMap
	filenameTofilePartNumbersMap
