Scripts and bits from the "tests" folder
========================================

(see also "raocexperiments" repository for experimental results:
git clone git://nubisave.org/git/raocexperiments)

+++++++ Prerequisite scripts +++++++

FuSim/
 -> simulates a bandwidth-restricted and quality-constrained network
    storage
 => invocation (as FUSE module): python FuSim/fusim.py <options...>

+++++++ Data acquisition scripts +++++++

createsamplefiles.sh
 -> creates files with random contents and varying sizes 4kB to 128MB
    and their checksums into the git-ignored "samplefiles" folder
 => invocation: ./createsamplefiles.sh

fuse_tests.sh
 -> checks various file system operations on a mounted FUSE module
    such as the Nubisave splitter
 => invocation: ./fuse_tests.sh <mountpoint> <file-/foldername>

mem.sh
 -> reports about the memory usage of a mounted Nubisave splitter
 => invocation [through system_test.sh]: ./mem.sh <logfile>

starttests.sh
 -> High-level wrapper around createsamplefiles.sh, gengnuplot.sh and
    nubi3d.dem which measures and visualises read/write performance
 => invocation: ./starttests.sh

system_test.sh
 -> wrapper around mem.sh, plot_mem.gnp and various other tests, like Sikuli
 => invocation: ./system_test.sh <logdir> [<iozonedir>]

scripts/
 -> various more or less self-explaining test scripts for splitter operations

+++++++ Data visualisation scripts +++++++

gengnuplot.sh
 -> visualises the output of `iozone -a`
 => invocation [through starttests.sh]: ./gengnuplot.sh <iozonelog> <test>

nubi3d.dem
 -> Gnuplot wrapper script for various read/write performance metrics,
    as produced by gengnuplot.sh, into git-ignored SVG files
 => invocation [through starttests.sh]: gnuplot nubi3d.dem

plot.gnp
 -> Gnuplot wrapper script for times (???)
 => invocation [through plot.sh]: gnuplot plot.gnp

plot_mem.gnp
 -> Gnuplot wrapper script for memory usage
 => invocation [through system_test.sh]: gnuplot plot_mem.gnp

plot.sh
 -> convenience script to execute and view resuls of plot.gnp
 => invocation: ./plot.sh

+++++++ Misc scripts, files and folders +++++++

hidrive/
 -> convenience script for STRATO HiDrive mounting
 !! not really a test/experiment script

nubisavetest/
 -> convenience script for T-Online Mediencenter and others - seems to
    do nothing
 !! not really a test/experiment script

tonlinetest/
 -> convenience script for T-Online Mediencenter mounting
 !! not really a test/experiment script

wualatest/
 -> convenience script for Wuala mounting
 !! not really a test/experiment script

systemtest/
 -> output directory for system_test.sh, explicitly not git-ignored
