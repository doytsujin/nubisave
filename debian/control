Description: Cloud/RAOC storage controller
 NubiSave is a flexible higher-level storage controller for the
 cloud, in particular for Redundant Arrays of Optimal Cloud
 storage providers.
 With NubiSave, data can be dispersed (split) across a number
 of independent providers, thus increasing the security,
 retrieval and transmission quality.
